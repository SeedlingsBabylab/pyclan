# pyclan

This is a Python library for working with CHAT (.cha) files that are used by the CLAN audio annotation program.

More info about CLAN: [here](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/)

Note: the parser doesn't comply with the entire CHAT file specification. It implements a subset of the specification (enough to parse the SEEDLings corpus).
