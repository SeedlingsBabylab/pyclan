# pyclan compatible with python3.7

Changes made to forked pyclan:
- upgraded to python3.7
- integrated codecheck package
  

This is a Python library for working with CHAT (.cha) files that are used by the CLAN audio annotation program.

More info about CLAN: [here](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/)

Note: the parser doesn't comply with the entire CHAT file specification. It implements a subset of the specification (enough to parse the SEEDLings corpus).


## install

```
$: pip install git+https://github.com/SeedlingsBabylab/pyclan.git
```

## usage examples:

detailed usage examples can be found in this notebook, [here](pyclan_examples.ipynb)
